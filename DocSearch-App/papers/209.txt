 Symbolic computation  

A variable-coefficient nonisospectral modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation with two Painlev, branches is investigated in this paper. Through the generalized singular manifold method, a couple of Lax pairs for such an equation are constructed on account of the relationship between manifolds and eigenfunctions. Meanwhile, utilizing the aforementioned Lax pairs, a binary Darboux transformation of this equation has been presented.
