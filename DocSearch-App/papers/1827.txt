 Parallel computing  

High resolution reconstruction technology is developed to help enhance the spatial resolution of observational images for ground-based solar telescopes, such as speckle masking. Near real-time reconstruction performance is achieved on a high performance cluster using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, much time is spent in reconstructing solar subimages in such a speckle reconstruction. We design and implement a novel parallel method for speckle masking reconstruction of solar subimage on a shared memory machine using the OpenMP. Real tests are performed to verify the correctness of our codes. We present the details of several parallel reconstruction steps. The parallel implementation between various modules shows a great speed increase as compared to single thread serial implementation, and a speedup of about 2.5 is achieved in one subimage reconstruction. The timing result for reconstructing one subimage with 256 x 256 pixels shows a clear advantage with greater number of threads. This novel parallel method can be valuable in real-time reconstruction of solar images, especially after porting to a high performance cluster.
