 Operating systems  

In general, operating systems (OSs) are designed to mediate access to device hardware by applications. They process different kinds of system calls using an indiscriminate kernel with the same configuration. Applications in cloud computing platforms are constructed from service components. Each of the service components is assigned separately to an individual virtual machine (VM), which leads to homogeneous system calls on each VM. In addition, the requirements for kernel function and configuration of system parameters from different VMs are different. Therefore, the suit-to-all design incurs an unnecessary performance overhead and restricts the OS's processing capacity in cloud computing. In this paper, we propose an adaptive model for cloud computing to resolve the conflict between generality and performance. Our model adaptively specializes the OS of a VM according to the resource-consuming characteristics of workloads on the VM. We implement a prototype of the adaptive model, vSpec. There are five classes of VM: CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, I/O-intensive, network-intensive and compound, according to the resource-consuming characteristics of the workloads running on the VMs. vSpec specializes the OS of a VM according to the VM class. We perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of vSpec on benchmarks and real-world applications.
