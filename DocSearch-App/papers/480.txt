 Computer graphics  

As part of an effort to expand broadcasting services based on Japanese Sign Language (JSL), we are investigating various types of JSL-based service for delivering information to people whose first language is JSL. In this report, we present a JSL computer graphics (CG) prototype system using Japan's integrated broadcast-broadband (IBB) framework, Hybridcast. Delivery of JSL CG contents using the Internet enables JSL CG animation to be displayed in conjunction with a broadcast program on second screen devices such as smartphones and tablets. The signals providing emergency information are triggered by reception of an event message (EM) embedded in the transport stream (TS) transmitted over the air. Testing showed that emergency earthquake information can be provided by JSL CG animation within 2 seconds of EM reception. It also showed that local government evacuation instructions corresponding to the user's residence (based on location information stored in the TV set) can be displayed on a second screen device. Despite the dependence of the drawing speed on the performance of the hardware and web browser, the proposed system is a promising way to provide information services in JSL.
