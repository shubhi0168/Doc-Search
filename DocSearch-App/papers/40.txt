A crucial problem in modern software engineering is maturity assessment of organizations developing software, however, research has shown that efficiency is a clearer indicator of agile transformation readiness. We propose utilizing a process model of RUP development methodology, as a pattern for comparing it with the examined process. Two factors were proposed to assess maturity and factor determining the efficiency of the RUP process. The above mentioned RUP model concept is based on a multi-agent based simulation (MABS). It presents goals and behaviours of agents as well as components of the agent system environment. To confirm the usefulness of the method for assessment of organization's maturity, a two-fold experiment was undertaken. The results confirm the usefulness of the model in efficiency and maturity assessment. First part consisted of tuning the simulation internal parameters to the development process. In the second part we propose three factors that can be used to assess efficiency and maturity of a RUP IT organization. The proposed coefficients are an extension of previous research by the authors, devoted to the assessment of organizational readiness for agile processes transformation.
