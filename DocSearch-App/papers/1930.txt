 Machine learning  

Improving disaster management and recovery techniques is one of national priorities given the huge toll caused by man-made and nature calamities. Data-driven disaster management aims at applying advanced data collection and analysis technologies to achieve more effective and responsive disaster management, and has undergone considerable progress in the last decade. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no work that both summarizes recent progress and suggests future directions for this emerging research area. To remedy this situation, we provide a systematic treatment of the recent developments in data-driven disaster management. Specifically, we first present a general overview of the requirements and system architectures of disaster management systems and then summarize state-of-the-art data-driven techniques that have been applied on improving situation awareness as well as in addressing users' information needs in disaster management. We also discuss and categorize general data-mining and machine-learning techniques in disaster management. Finally, we recommend several research directions for further investigations.
