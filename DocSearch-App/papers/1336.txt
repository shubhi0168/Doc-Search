 Parallel computing  

Digital down converter (DDC) is a time-intensive and data-intensive computing task and considered as the key technology in software defined radio. This paper proposes a high-performance implementation of DDC on a graphics processing unit (GPU) using CUDA, which is composed of a numerically controlled oscillator stage, a cascaded integrator-comb (CIC) decimation filter stage, and a finite impulse response (FIR) filter stage. The GPU implementation and optimizing of all the stages are studied in detail. Additionally, for handling a long-duration signal, the signal data sequence is truncated into segments; the overlap-save and overlap-add mechanisms were applied in CIC stage and FIR stage, respectively. Finally, experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of GPU-based DDC with respect to a sequential version CPU implementation and an OpenMP implementation (16 threads). Experimental results demonstrate that the DDC achieves significant improvements on the GPU; the maximum speed ups in numerically controlled oscillator stage, CIC stage, and FIR stage can achieve more than 1242, 527, and 179 times, including data-transfer, kernel execution, and other processing operations; the overall speed up of DDC can achieve more than 180. In the meantime, the speed ups of GPU implementation are far above the OpenMP implementation (about 2.5-6.4 times).
