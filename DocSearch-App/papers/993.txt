 Computer graphics  

Computer graphics in combination with mobile devices finds many applications in the fields of entertainment, education or displaying data. The amount of information that can be shown to the user in real time depends mostly on the speed of visualisation process and thus on the optimization of the graphic chain during application development. For the development of optimized solution, the developers need to be familiar with the possibilities and differences of the developing platform. An appropriate way can be the implementation of graphics engine and sample scenes that show basic indicators of a quality level of current smart devices. This paper focuses on the problem of selecting a proper graphics engine for selected visualization task as well as the optimization of several most used techniques for visualisation of different types of 3D effects. Quality of the implementation is finally evaluated on the developed testing engine which provides relevant data in the sense of Frame per Second (FPS) based on the visualisation speed. The second aspect of quality is evaluated by the visual correctness of four selected scenes such as water level, volumetric light scattering, fur simulation and forest.
