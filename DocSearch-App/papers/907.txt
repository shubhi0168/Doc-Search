 Distributed computing  

Cloud computing is one of the Information Technology services which are provided from IT infrastructures to application services. It is the combination of Distributed computing and virtualization technology using virtual machines, an essential component in Cloud computing. Therefore, task scheduling is an important matter to consider for virtual machines to balance load of each machine and to efficiently use the resources in Cloud computing. This paper proposes the use of Heuristic task scheduling with Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for virtual machines in heterogeneous Cloud computing, called HABC. The research aim is to introduce HABC, which is a new task scheduling and load balancing algorithm, for virtual machines in heterogeneous environments to reduce the makespan in the system. In the experiments, CloudSim was simulated to compare various types of the optimization task scheduling in using the virtual machines. The experimental results indicated that using the proposed Artificial Bee Colony algorithm when large job was considered first (HABC_LJF) in virtual machine scheduling, improved the efficiency in task scheduling and load balancing of virtual machines in Cloud computing. In addition, the proposed algorithm can minimize the makespan even if the tasks are increased and the different types of data are distributed.
