 Relational databases  

Data Integration (DI) is the problem of combining a set of heterogeneous, autonomous data sources and providing the user with a unified view of these data. Integrating data raises several challenges, since the designer usually encounters incompatible data models characterized by differences in structure and semantics. One of the hardest challenges is to define correspondences between schema elements (e.g., attributes) to determine how they relate to each other. Since most business data is currently stored in relational databases, here present a declarative and formal approach to specify 1-to-1, 1-m, and m-to-n correspondences between relational schema components. Differently from usual approaches, our (CAs) have semantics and can deal with outer-joins and data-metadata relationships. Finally, we demonstrate how to use the CAs to generate mapping expressions in the form of SQL queries, and we present some preliminary tests to verify the performance of the generated queries.
