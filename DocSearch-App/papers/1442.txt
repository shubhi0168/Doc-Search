 Relational databases  

During the last few years, the revolution of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram led to a daily increasing of data that are heterogeneous in their sources, data models, and platforms. Heterogeneous data sources have many forms such as the www, deep web, relational databases systems, No-SQL database systems, hierarchal data systems, semistructured files, in which data are usually allocated on different machines (distributed) and have different data models (heterogeneous). Large-scale data integration efforts demonstrate that their most valuable contribution is implementing a data integration platform that provides a uniform access to the heterogeneous data sources, as well as the different versions of data reported by the same data source over time. Furthermore, the platform must be able to integrate data from a broad range of data authoring devices and database management systems. It also should be accessible by almost types of data querying devices to ensure globally querying the integration platform from any place on earth anytime and receiving the query result in any data format. In this paper, we create a resource oriented heterogeneous data integration platform (ROHDIP) that facilitates the data integration process and implements the objectives discussed above. We use the resource oriented architecture ROA to support the uniform access by most types of data querying devices from anywhere and to improve the query response time.
