 Parallel computing  

A dimension splitting method (DSM) with Crank-Nicolson time discrete strategy for a three-dimensional heat equation is proposed. The basic idea is to simulate the three-Dimensional problem by numerically solving a series of two-dimensional problems in parallel fashion. Convergence and error estimation for the DSM scheme are derived in the paper. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the DSM scheme.
