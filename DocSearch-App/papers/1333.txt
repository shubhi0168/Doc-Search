DigiMathArt is an interdisciplinary method of teaching and learning that uses computer graphics and programming in order to make the mathematics concepts easier to understand. By combining arts, programming and mathematics it helps in creating complex connectomes, the brain highways to understanding. The idea of DigiMathArt method is to describe the concepts of mathematics by means of logic games and graphics. Kids are trained dynamically, according to their speed of processing the information - not necessary according to the age - and are then evaluated. At this point, the only evaluation of this method of teaching and learning goes by means of the national standardized tests. The pupils enrolled in the public and private systems of education, trained with DigiMathArt method, perform as high as possible when tested, and the home / unschoolers manifest a better ability to integrate and comprehend math concepts not only in math, but in other activities that involve critical thinking and other complex concepts.
