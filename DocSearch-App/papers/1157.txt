 network security  

Critical node discovery plays a vital role in assessing the vulnerability of a computer network to malicious attacks and failures and provides a useful tool with which one can greatly improve network security and reliability. In this paper, we propose a new metric to characterize the criticality of a node in an arbitrary computer network which we refer to as the Combined Banzhaf & Diversity Index (CBDI). The metric utilizes a diversity index which is based on the variability of a node's attributes relative to its neighbours and the Banzhaf power index which characterizes the degree of participation of a node in forming shortest paths. The Banzhaf power index is inspired from the theory of voting games in game theory. The proposed metric is evaluated using analysis and simulations. The criticality of nodes in a network is assessed based on the degradation in network performance achieved when these nodes are removed. We use several performance metrics to evaluate network performance including the algebraic connectivity which is a spectral metric characterizing the connectivity robustness of the network. Extensive simulations in a number of network topologies indicate that the proposed CBDI index chooses more critical nodes which, when removed, degrade network performance to a greater extent than if critical nodes based on other criticality metrics were removed.
