Currently, there are no developed methods to detect sharp wave transients that exist in the latent phase after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in order to determine if these micro-scale transients are potential biomarkers of HI. A major issue with sharp waves in the HI-EEG is that they possess a large variability in their sharp wave profile making it difficult to build a compact ` footprint of uncertainty' (FOU) required for ideal performance of a Type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS) classifier. In this paper, we develop a novel computational EEG analysis method to robustly detect sharp waves using over 30 h of post occlusion HI-EEG from an equivalent, in utero, preterm fetal sheep model cohort. We demonstrate that initial wavelet transform (WT) of the sharp waves stabilizes the variation in their profile and thus permits a highly compact FOU to be built, hence, optimizing the performance of a Type-2 FLS. We demonstrate that this method leads to higher overall performance of 94% +/- 1 for the clinical 64Hz sampled EEG and 97% +/- 1 for the high resolution 1024 Hz sampled EEG that is improved upon over conventional standard wavelet 67% +/- 5 and 82% +/- 3, respectively, and fuzzy approaches 88% +/- 2 and 90% +/- 3, respectively, when performed in isolation.
