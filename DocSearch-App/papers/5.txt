 Data structures  

1. While phylogenies have been getting easier to build, it has been difficult to reuse, combine and synthesize the information they provide because published trees are often only available as image files, and taxonomic information is not standardized across studies. 2. The Open Tree of Life (OTL) project addresses these issues by providing a digital tree that encompasses all organisms, built by combining taxonomic information and published phylogenies. The project also provides tools and services to query and download parts of this synthetic tree, as well as the source data used to build it. Here, we present rot1, an R package to search and download data fromthe Open Tree of Life directly in R. 3. rot1 uses common data structures allowing researchers to take advantage of the rich set of tools and methods that are available in R to manipulate, analyse and visualize phylogenies. Here, and in the vignettes accompanying the package, we demonstrate how rot1 can be used with other R packages to analyse biodiversity data. 4. As phylogenies are being used in a growing number of applications, rot1 facilitates access to phylogenetic data and allows their integration with statistical methods and data sources available inR.
