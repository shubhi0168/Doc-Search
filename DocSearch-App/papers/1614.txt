 Data structures  

Findings from information-seeking behavior research can inform application development. In this report we provide a system description of Spark, an application based on findings from Serendipitous Knowledge Discovery studies and data structures known as semantic predications. Background information and the previously published IF-SKD model (outlining Serendipitous Knowledge Discovery in online environments) illustrate the potential use of information-seeking behavior in application design. A detailed overview of the Spark system illustrates how methodologies in design and retrieval functionality enable production of semantic predication graphs tailored to evoke Serendipitous Knowledge Discovery in users.
