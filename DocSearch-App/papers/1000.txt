 Algorithm design  

Computer numerical control (CNC) technology is a key technology in machine tools and is also the base of industrial unit computerization. CNC machines are operated by controllers, which have a software module inside known as interpreter. The function of an interpreter is to extract data from computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system-generated code and convert it to controller motion commands. However, with the development of numerical control technology, existing CNC systems are limited with interpreter lacking in expandibility, modularity, and openness. In order to overcome these problems, open architecture technology (OAC) was employed in CNC controller. In this paper, a new technique is presented for the interpretation of the International Standards Organization (ISO) 6983 data interface model. The proposed technique is able to interpret ISO 6983 data and translate it to the internal structure required by the CNC machine. It takes an input file in text format and extracts position, feed rate, tool, spindle, and other data. It is also able to generate output in text and EXtensible Markup Language (XML) files as per user defined file structure. The use of .txt and .xml files enables shop floor data modification and internet accessibility facilities in CNC system. The paper includes an introduction, brief description of the architecture, algorithm design, operational pattern, and validation of the system through experimental studies. The output of these experiments illustrated satisfactory performance of the interpreter with an OAC CNC system.
