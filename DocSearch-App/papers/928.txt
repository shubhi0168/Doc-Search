 Distributed computing  

Clustering is one of the important data mining issues, especially for large and distributed data analysis. Distributed computing environments such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks involve separated/scattered data sources, distributed among the peers. According to unpredictable growth and dynamic nature of P2P networks, data of peers are constantly changing. Due to the high volume of computing and communications and privacy concerns, processing of these types of data should be applied in a distributed way and without central management. Today, most applications of P2P systems focus on unstructured P2P systems. In unstructured P2P networks, spreading gossip is a simple and efficient method of communication, which can adapt to dynamic conditions in these networks. Recently, some algorithms with different pros and cons have been proposed for data clustering in P2P networks. In this paper, by combining a novel method for extracting the representative data, a gossip-based protocol and a new centralized clustering method, a Gossip Based Distributed Clustering algorithm for P2P networks called GBDC-P2P is proposed. The GBDC-P2P algorithm is suitable for data clustering in unstructured P2P networks and it adapts to the dynamic conditions of these networks. In the GBDC-P2P algorithm, peers perform data clustering operation with a distributed approach only through communications with their neighbours. The GBDC-P2P does not need to rely on a central server and it performs asynchronously. Evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of the GBDC-P2P algorithm. Also, a comparative analysis with other well-established methods illustrates the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
