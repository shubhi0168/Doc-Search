Fuzzy logic has been used for flexible database querying for more than 30 years. This paper examines some of the issues of flexible querying which seem to have potential for further research and development from theoretical and practical points of view. More precisely, defining appropriate fuzzy sets for queries, calculating matching degrees for commutative and non-commutative query conditions, preferences, merging constraints and wishes, empty and overabundant answers, and views on practical realizations are discussed in this paper. Suggestions how to solve them and integrate into one compact solution are also outlined in this paper.
