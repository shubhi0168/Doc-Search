Advances in geographic information, interactive two-and three-dimensional map visualization accompanied with the proliferation of mobile devices and location data have tremendously benefited the development of geo-educational applications. We demonstrate LIMO; a web-based programming environment that is centered around operations on interactive geographical maps, location-oriented data, and the operations of synthetic objects that move on the maps. LIMO materializes a low-cost open-ended environment that integrates interactive maps and spatial data (e.g., Open-StreetMap). The unique advantage of LIMO is that it relates programming concepts to interactive geographical maps and location data. LIMO offers an environment for students to learn how to program by providing: 1. An easy-to-program library of map and spatial operations, 2. High-quality interactive map graphics, and 3. Example programs that introduce users to writing programs in the LIMO environment.
