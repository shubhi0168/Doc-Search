 Cryptography  

Highly optimised reconfigurable hardware architecture is proposed of 64 bit block ciphers MISTY1 and KASUMI for wide-area cryptographic applications. The reconfigurable hardware architecture is comprised of reconfigurable components consisting of FL function, FO/FI function and XOR function designed to perform MISTY1 and KASUMI algorithms round transformation functions. In addition, reconfigurable FO/FI function is adequate to generate MISTY1 extended keys for onward use in MISTY1 round transformation function. The substitution functions S9 and S7 for MISTY1 and KASUMI algorithms are optimised for area and throughput. Common sub-expression elimination for AND-XOR logic combined with permutation/combination technique for AND gates reduces the area considerably, whereas parallel execution improves the throughput. With this design approach, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations using Synopsys Design Complier, SMIC 0.18 mu m at 1.8 V achieved an area of 3481 NAND gates having throughput of 130.2 and 154.56 Mbits/s for MISTY1 and KASUMI, respectively. Synthesised FPGA implementation using Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA yielded an area of 487 configurable logic block (CLB) Slices having throughput of 209.43 and 248.7 Mbits/s for MISTY1 and KASUMI, respectively. Detailed design and performance analysis of reconfigurable hardware architecture of 64 bit block ciphers MISTY1 and KASUMI for ASIC implementations is described.
