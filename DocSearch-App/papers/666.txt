Background: MiR-101-3p can promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in breast cancer (BC) cells. However, its mechanisms in BC are not fully understood. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the target genes, pathways, and networks of miR-101-3p in BC is necessary. Material/Methods: The miR-101 profiles for 781 patients with BC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed. Gene expression profiling of GSE31397 with miR-101-3p transfected MCF-7 cells and scramble control cells was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The potential genes targeted by miR-101-3p were also predicted. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway and network analyses were constructed for the DEGs and predicted genes. Results: In the TCGA data, a low level of miR-101-2 expression might represent a diagnostic (AUC: 0.63) marker, and the miR-101-1 was a prognostic (HR=1.79) marker. MiR-101-1 was linked to the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and miR-101-2 was associated with the tumor (T), lymph node (N), and metastasis (M) stages of BC. Moreover, 427 genes were selected from the 921 DEGs in GEO and the 7924 potential target genes from the prediction databases. These genes were related to transcription, metabolism, biosynthesis, and proliferation. The results were also significantly enriched in the VEGF, mTOR, focal adhesion, Wnt, and chemokine signaling pathways. Conclusions: MiR-101-1 and miR-101-2 may be prospective biomarkers for the prognosis and diagnosis of BC, respectively, and are associated with diverse clinical parameters. The target genes of miR-101-3p regulate the development and progression of BC. These results provide insight into the pathogenic mechanism and potential therapies for BC.
