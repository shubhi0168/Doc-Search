 Software engineering  

A recommendation system for software engineering (RSSE) is a software application that provides information items estimated to be valuable for a software engineering task in a given context. Present the results of a systematic literature review to reveal the typical functionality offered by existing RSSEs, research gaps, and possible research directions. We evaluated 46 papers studying the benefits, the data requirements, the information and recommendation types, and the effort requirements of RSSE systems. We include papers describing tools that support source code related development published between 2003 and 2013. The results show that RSSEs typically visualize source code artifacts. They aim to improve system quality, make the development process more efficient and less expensive, lower developer's cognitive load, and help developers to make better decisions. They mainly support reuse actions and debugging, implementation, and maintenance phases. The majority of the systems are reactive. Unexploited opportunities lie in the development of recommender systems outside the source code domain. Furthermore, current RSSE systems use very limited context information and rely on simple models. Context-adapted and proactive behavior could improve the acceptance of RSSE systems in practice.
