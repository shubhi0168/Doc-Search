 Software engineering  

For conclusively predicting the quality of any software system, software testing plays an important but a vital role. For finding faults early and to observe failures (anomalies) before implementation stage, software testing is done and if bugs (defects) are detected then software is passed through maintenance phase. The success and failure of a software project is often attributed to the development methodology used. It is also observed that in many scenarios, the software engineering methods are not implemented in their true spirit. Moreover, many of the development methodologies don't cater the change very well, because they follow a predefined development path which allows very less deviation. In software testing, regression testing is the important type of software testing. When any change made on the software then regression testing is done to check that it doesn't influence other parts of software. In regression testing, test cases are prioritized in order to reuse new test cases and existing test cases. Test case prioritization is done by using different techniques. This paper presents a review of different test case prioritization techniques.
