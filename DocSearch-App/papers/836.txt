 Symbolic computation  

By employing the generalized ( G'/ G)- expansion method and symbolic computation, we obtain new exact solutions of the ( 3 + 1) dimensional generalized B-type Kadomtsev- Petviashvili equation, which include the traveling wave exact solutions and the non- traveling wave exact solutions showed by the hyperbolic function and the trigonometric function. Meanwhile, some interesting physics structure are discussed.
