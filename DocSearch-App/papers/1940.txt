 Symbolic computation  

In a magnetized e-p-i plasma with two-electron temperatures, the (3 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation for the ion-acoustic envelope solitons is hereby investigated. Bright and dark soliton solutions are both obtained. It is found that the soliton amplitude is inversely related to P, Q and R, with P, Q and R respectively as the coefficients of the dispersive term, nonlinear term and combined effect of the transverse perturbation and magnetic field. Head-on interactions are displayed, and with Q and R decreasing, can be transferred into the overtaking ones. Bright bound-state solitons are obtained, and the interaction period decreases with Q increasing. Both the head-on and overtaking interactions between the two dark solitons are displayed, and such a head-on interaction can be transformed into the overtaking one with R increasing. Upon the introduction of the external perturbation, the developed and weak chaos are observed. Phase projections and power spectra are presented. Difference between the two chaotic motions roots in the inequality between the nonlinear and perturbed terms. Developed chaos can be weakened with Q decreasing, or with the frequency of external perturbation increasing.
