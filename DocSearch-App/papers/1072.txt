Contemporary journalism explores new formulas at the international level to prepare information by means of transmedia story-telling and mobile devices, where multimedia and hypertextual communication are enriched with more efficient contents. They involve universal formulas where the information output seeks the audience's participation with their comments or retransmissions by means of social networks, which generate a model of proactive television consumption by the social audience. This paper features the revision of journalism and transmedia communication as an innovation within the digital ecosystem, where it is possible to work with journalism texts, images, audio files, interactive videos, computer graphics, GIF files, maps, links, etc. These formats invite the audience to participate in genuine digital artworks in on-line reports and documentaries viewed on second screens. Transmedia communication is based on informative stories which are developed in multiple platforms. Each of them contributes in a different way to the global understanding of the story as a new narrative, selecting the most suitable channels to achieve added-value in the communication. There are no frontiers. The hybridization of languages and the technological convergence are the keys to a truly silent revolution which point towards an emerging model in contemporary journalism.
