Cellular learning automata (CLA) is a distributed computational model which was introduced in the last decade. This model combines the computational power of the cellular automata with the learning power of the learning automata. Cellular learning automata is composed from a lattice of cells working together to accomplish their computational task; in which each cell is equipped with some learning automata. Wide range of applications utilizes CLA such as image processing, wireless networks, evolutionary computation and cellular networks. However, the only input to this model is a reinforcement signal and so it cannot receive another input such as the state of the environment. In this paper, we introduce a new model of CLA such that each cell receives extra information from the environment in addition to the reinforcement signal. The ability of getting an extra input from the environment increases the computational power and flexibility of the model. We have designed some new algorithms for solving famous problems in pattern recognition and machine learning such as classification, clustering and image segmentation. All of them are based on the proposed CLA. We investigated performance of these algorithms through several computer simulations. Results of the new clustering algorithm shows acceptable performance on various data sets. CLA-based classification algorithm gets average precision 84% on eight data sets in comparison with SVM, KNN and Naive Bayes with average precision 88%, 84% and 75%, respectively. Similar results are obtained for semi-supervised classification based on the proposed CLA. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
