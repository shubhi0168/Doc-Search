 Parallel computing  

Distribution network analyses have been traditionally carried out by sequentially processing computational tasks, i.e., without taking advantage of parallel processing now available in multi-core machines. However, future distribution networks require studies that cater for the uncertainties due to the location and behavior of loads and low carbon technologies, resulting in a much more computationally demanding environment. This paper investigates the adoption of high performance computing (HPC) to accelerate probabilistic impact and control analyses carried out on residential low voltage (LV) networks with electric vehicles (EVs). First, the impacts of uncontrolled charging of EVs are quantified using a Monte Carlo-based approach using 1000 time-series daily simulations per penetration level (i.e., 0%-100%). Then, to mitigate these impacts, the coordinated management of the on-load tap changer and EVs is proposed considering a preventive control approach that caters for the uncertainties ahead (1000 scenarios). Two real residential, underground U.K. LV networks considering realistic demand and EV load profiles (1-min resolution) are analyzed. Results show that the processing time for the impact analysis is reduced almost proportionally to the number of cores. From the control perspective, it is demonstrated that HPC can be a feasible and implementable alternative in the management of future smart grids.
