 Structured Storage  

Due to the increasing complexity of the surgical working environment, increasingly technical solutions must be found to help relieve the surgeon. This objective is supported by a structured storage concept for all relevant device data. In this work, we present a concept and prototype development of a storage system to address intraoperative medical data. The requirements of such a system are described, and solutions for data transfer, processing, and storage are presented. In a subsequent study, a prototype based on the presented concept is tested for correct and complete data transmission and storage and for the ability to record a complete neurosurgical intervention with low processing latencies. In the final section, several applications for the presented data recorder are shown. The developed system based on the presented concept is able to store the generated data correctly, completely, and quickly enough even if much more data than expected are sent during a surgical intervention. The Surgical Data Recorder supports automatic recognition of the interventional situation by providing a centralized data storage and access interface to the OR communication bus. In the future, further data acquisition technologies should be integrated. Therefore, additional interfaces must be developed. The data generated by these devices and technologies should also be stored in or referenced by the Surgical Data Recorder to support the analysis of the OR situation.
