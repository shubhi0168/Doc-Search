 Data structures  

Cardinal trees (or tries of degree ) are a fundamental data structure, in particular for many text-processing algorithms. Each node in a cardinal tree has at most children, each labeled with a symbol from the alphabet . In this paper we introduce succinct representations for dynamic cardinal trees on nodes, requiring bits of space. These are the first dynamic cardinal tree representations that support a (fairly) complete set of operations while using almost optimal space. For , we show how the navigational and query operations on the tree can be supported in time, while supporting insertions and deletions of leaves in amortized time. For [and ], we show that the same set of operations can be supported in time (amortized in the case of insertions/deletions). We also show how to associate -bit satellite data to the tree nodes using extra bits. Finally, we show how the machinery introduced for dynamic cardinal trees can be adapted to represent dynamic binary trees using bits of space, so that the tree operations are supported in time (amortized in the case of insert/delete operations). We support adding satellite data to the tree nodes using extra bits [(vs. extra bits of the fastest previous dynamic representation from the literature], while providing several trade-offs for accessing/modifying the data.
