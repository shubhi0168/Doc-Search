Automatic segmentation of subtitles is a novel research field which has not been studied extensively to date. However, quality automatic subtitling is a real need for broadcasters which seek for automatic solutions given the demanding European audiovisual legislation. In this article, a method based on Conditional Random Field is presented to deal with the automatic subtitling segmentation. This is a continuation of a previous work in the field, which proposed a method based on Support Vector Machine classifier to generate possible candidates for breaks. For this study, two corpora in Basque and Spanish were used for experiments, and the performance of the current method was tested and compared with the previous solution and two rule-based systems through several evaluation metrics. Finally, an experiment with human evaluators was carried out with the aim of measuring the productivity gain in post-editing automatic subtitles generated with the new method presented.
