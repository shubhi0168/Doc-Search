 Distributed computing  

Cloud computing, a new paradigm in distributed computing, has gained wide popularity in a relatively short span of time. With the increase in the number, functionality and features of cloud services, it is more and more mind-boggling for the cloud users to find a trustworthy provider. Cloud users need to have confidence in cloud providers to migrate their critical data to cloud computing. There must be some means to determine reliability of service providers so that users can choose services with the assurance that the provider will not act malignantly. An effort has been made in this paper to formulate a hybrid model to calculate the trustworthiness of service providers. Cloud services are evaluated and trust value is calculated based on compliance and reputation. Service logs based compliance reflects dynamic trust. The reputation has been computed from collective user feedback. Feedback rating is the view of each user about the invoked services. The discovered services that fulfill the user requirements are ranked based on their trust values and top-k cloud services are recommended to the user. The proposed approach is efficient and considerably improves service-selection process in cloud applications.
