 Computer programming  

Grinding employs an abrasive product, usually a rotating wheel, which is brought into controlled contact with a workpiece surface. The grinding patterning process can be simulated using computer programming with specific user-defined parameters. To predict the surface pattern that will result from grinding with the grooved wheel, calculating the CAM parameters is very important. The intention of this research is to formulate CAM parameters for the generation of a surface pattern on a flat nominal surface by grinding with a wheel that has been prepared in a special way. A diamond dresser having a rounded tip is applied to prepare helical grooves on the conventional wheel's surface. With the intention of extracting CAM parameters, a mathematical model is developed for a grinding patterning process, starting from the unit pattern geometry of the workpiece plate. The models are characterized by the process parameters of grinding patterning such as unit pattern geometry, dressing parameters, wheel geometry and grinding conditions, as well as work surface geometry. A computer program with a user interface is developed using Matlab according to the proposed mathematical model to predict surface pattern. In addition, several examples of simulation results of the 3D wheel geometry model and corresponding patterned surfaces have been displayed using the proposed CAM parameters as input. Formulated CAM parameters can be used to control the actual grinding process or predict the ground surface pattern.
