 Symbolic computation  

An efficient procedure for calculating the electromagnetic fields in multilayered cylindrical structures is reported in this paper. Using symbolic computation, spectral Green's functions, suitable for numerical implementations are determined in compact and closed forms. Applications are presented for structures with two dielectric layers.
