Aiming at solving the problems on dynamic occlusion of complete denture in the field of dental restoration, this paper presents a computerized system from the viewpoint of integration of related disciplines. Firstly the displacement matrix of mandibular movement on Hanau articulator is established by means of the method of the direction cosine matrix in spatial mechanism. Secondly by programming in Matlab 6.5 (a language for technical computing), VC6.0 ++ and VTK (Visualization ToolKit), and adopting these techniques such as laser scanning, computer graphics, and computer database, a 3D digitized model of the denture has been reconstructed; And then the 3D coordinate data of mark points are measured. On basis of this digitized model, the computerized simulation system of occlusal contacts for complete denture is developed. With the aid of this system, the dynamic occlusive procedure of the complete denture mounted on Hanau articulator is clearly observed at any required angle and location of views, in addition, the posit ions of the occlusal contacts is obtained. Therefore this study is helpful to research on the dynamic occlusion of complete denture and improve dental restorative procedures.
