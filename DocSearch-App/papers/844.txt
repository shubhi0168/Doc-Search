 Symbolic computation  

By using symbolic computation software(Maple), a generalized Dirac soliton hierarchy is derived from a new matrix spectral problem associated with the Lie algebra sl(2,R). A bi-Hamiltonian structure yielding Liouville integrability is furnished by the trace identity. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
