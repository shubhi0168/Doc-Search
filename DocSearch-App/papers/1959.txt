In aquaculture, fish feeding behavior under culture conditions holds important information for the aquaculturist. In this study, near-infrared imaging was used to observe feeding processes of fish as a novel method for quantifying variations in fish feeding behavior. First, images of the fish feeding activity were collected using a near-infrared industrial camera installed at the top of the tank. A binary image of the fish was obtained following a series of steps such as image enhancement, background subtraction, and target extraction. Moreover, to eliminate the effects of splash and reflection on the result, a reflective frame classification and removal method based on the Support Vector Machine and Gray-Level Gradient Co-occurrence Matrix was proposed. Second, the centroid of the fish was calculated by the order moment, and then, the centroids were used as a vertex in Delaunay Triangulation. Finally, the flocking index of fish feeding behavior (FIFFB) was calculated to quantify the feeding behavior of a fish shoal according to the results of the Delaunay Triangulation, and the FIFFB values of the removed reflective frames were fitted by the Least Squares Polynomial Fitting method. The results show that variations in fish feeding behaviors can be accurately quantified and analyzed using the FIFFB values, for which the linear correlation coefficient versus expert manual scoring reached 0.945. This method provides an effective method to quantify fish behavior, which can be used to guide practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
