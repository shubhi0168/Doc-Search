 Cryptography  

Image encryption has been an attractive research field in recent years. The chaos-based cryptographic algorithms have suggested some new and efficient ways to develop secure image encryption techniques. This paper proposes a novel image encryption scheme, which is based on the chaotic tent map. Image encryption systems based on such map show some better performances. Firstly, the chaotic tent map is modified to generate chaotic key stream that is more suitable for image encryption. Secondly, the chaos-based key stream is generated by a 1-D chaotic tent map, which has a better performance in terms of randomness properties and security level. The performance and security analysis of the proposed image encryption scheme is performed using well-known ways. The results of the fail-safe analysis are inspiring, and it can be concluded that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure.
