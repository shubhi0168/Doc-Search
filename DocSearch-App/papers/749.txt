 Cryptography  

Based on logical GHZ states and logical Bell states, two robust quantum key agreement protocols are proposed, which can be immune to the collective-dephasing noise and the collective-rotation noise, respectively. The delayed measurement technique ensures that two participants can fairly negotiate a shared key and any one of them cannot successfully perform the participant attacks. The two protocols are congenitally free from the Trojan horse attacks and they can resist against other outsider attacks with the help of the decoy state technology. Moreover, they have no information leakage problem and achieve high qubit efficiency.
