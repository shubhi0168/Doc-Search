 Relational databases  

Database table having lots of records, that the record will be ranked. In this ranking process, we are having some problems like how will be ranked by selection condition, which record will be ranked first. We are using to find highest possible among all the tables in a record and to implement maximizing problem in a relation, which is used to find application promotion and characterization. The baseline approach applied greedy method which gives high accurate result compared to exhaustive enumeration. In this work, we are going to propose a NAIVE method for fining the ranking in a priority based, it will give more efficient about fining rank. Our contributions include a linear-time algorithm for determining the optimal selection range for an ordinal attribute and techniques for choosing and prioritizing the most promising selection predicates to apply. In addition, we require a single predicate for each attribute. The dis-junction of predicates can include the table which are inferior to attributes, so for such predicates the input size of predicate selection module is the whole dataset which is large compared to attributes of the domain size.
