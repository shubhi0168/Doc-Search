 Cryptography  

Access control model-based security plays very crucial role in security. Cloud computing is one of the emerging and challenging fields. In the implementation explained in this paper, issues related with cloud security are tried to resolve to some extent using access control model security. Encryption, also being part of access control-based model, also incorporated for better security. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model along with AES-RSA encryption algorithm is implemented to achieve efficient security. The main aim of this work is to design a framework which uses the cryptography concepts to store data in cloud storage and allowing access to that data using role perspective with the smallest amount of time and cost for encryption and decryption processes.
