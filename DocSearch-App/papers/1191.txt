 network security  

Cyber physical systems (CPS) are used to control chemical processes, and can be found in manufacturing, civil infrastructure, energy industry, transportation and in many more places. There is one common characteristic in these areas, their operation is critical as a malfunction can potential be life-threatening. In the past, an attack against the cyber part of the systems can lead to physical consequences. The first well known attack against a CPS was Stuxnet in 2010. It is challenging to develop countermeasures in this field without endangering the normal operation of the underlying system. In our research, our goal was to detect attacks without interfering with the cyber physical systems in any way. This can be realized by an anomaly detection system using passive network monitoring. Our approach is based on analysing the state of the physical process by interpreting the communication between the control system and the supervisory system. This state can be compared to a model based prediction of the system, which can serve as a solid base for intrusion detection. In order to realize our intrusion detection system, a testbed was built based on widely used Siemens PLCs. Our implementation consists of three main parts. The first task is to understand the network communication in order to gain information about the controlled process. This was realized by analysing and deeply understanding the publicly undocumented Siemens management protocol. The resulting protocol parser was integrated into the widely-used Bro network security monitoring framework. Gathering information about the process state for a prolonged time creates time series. With these time series, as the second step, statistical models of the physical process can be built to predict future states. As the final step, the new states of the physical process can be compared with the predicted states. Significant differences can be considered as an indicator of compromise.
