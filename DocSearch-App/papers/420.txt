 Parallel computing  

Appropriate structural analysis and optimization methods are of great significance for the conceptual design of automotive body-in-white (BIW) structure. This paper simplifies BIW structure as a spatial semi-rigid framed structure to provide early-stage predictions. Then a novel exact transfer stiffness matrix method (TSMM) is proposed for both static and dynamic analyses of three-dimensional semi-rigid framed structures. The matrix storage and equation solution techniques for large-scale engineering structures are also considered. Additionally, a size optimization mathematical model for BIW conceptual structure is formulated and solved by genetic algorithm (GA). Afterwards, to promote the conceptual design of BIW structure, an object-oriented MATLAB toolbox, based on TSMM, is developed. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) and strategy design pattern are employed to facilitate the development of the toolbox. Distributed parallel computing technique is adopted to speed up the former sequential optimization algorithm with simple modifications. Lastly, the validity of this easy-used toolbox is demonstrated by a benchmarking auto-body. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
