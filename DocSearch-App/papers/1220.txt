 Relational databases  

Data storage and information retrieval are some of the most important aspects when it comes to the development of a language corpus. Currently most corpora use either relational databases or indexed file systems. When selecting a data storage system, most important facts to consider are the speeds of data insertion and information retrieval. Other than the aforementioned two approaches, currently there are various database systems which have different strengths that can be more useful. This paper compares the performance of data storage and retrieval mechanisms which use relational databases, graph databases, column store databases and indexed file systems for various steps such as inserting data into corpus and retrieving information from it, and tries to suggest an optimal storage architecture for a language corpus.
