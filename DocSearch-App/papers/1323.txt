 Relational databases  

Developing Natural Language Query Interface to Relational Databases has gained much interest in research community since forty years. This can be termed as structured free query interface as it allows the users to retrieve the data from the database without knowing the underlying schema. Structured free query interface should address majorly two problems. Querying the system with Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) is comfortable for the naive users but it is difficult for the machine to understand. The other problem is that the users can query the system with different expressions to retrieve the same information. The different words used in the query can have same meaning and also the same word can have multiple meanings. Hence it is the responsibility of the NLI to understand the exact meaning of the word in the particular context. In this paper, a generic NLI Database system has proposed which contains various phases. The exact meaning of the word used in the query in particular context is obtained using ontology constructed for customer database. The proposed system is evaluated using customer database with precision, recall and f1-measure. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
