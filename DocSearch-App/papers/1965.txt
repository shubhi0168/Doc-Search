In China, the number of the power station increases quickly. According to the information from the Internet, From 2001 to August 2005, State Environmental Protection Administration has approved 472 thermal power projects, and the installed capacity is as much as 344382MW. In which, 135 thermal power projects are approved in 2001, the installed capacity is as much as 107590MW, 207% more than last year; 213 thermal power projects are approved From January to August in 2005, the installed capacity is as much as 168546MW, 420% more than last year. If these power stations all come online, Chinese installed capacity will be as much as 5.82 billion KW, 145% more than 2000. In December 2006, the growth of the power stations keeps high levels. The same month, the whole country's generating capacity was 2266 billion kilowatt-hour, 15.5% more than last year. As the rise of the winter electricity consumption, the generating capacity of power projects increased quickly. The genearating capacity of power projects in December was 10.9% more than last month. From January to December in 2006 the whole country's generating capacity was 23009 billion kilowatt-hour, 15.08% more than last year. From January to October in 2007 the whole country's generating capacity was 21756 billion kilowatt-hour, 16.04% more than last year. The generating capacity in August had the largest number, which was 2390 billion kilowatt-hour, 10.19% more than last year.
