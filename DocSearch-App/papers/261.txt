 Image processing  

Adsorption processes are responsible for detection of cancer biomarkers in biosensors (and immunosensors), which can be captured with various principles of detection. In this study, we used a biosensor made with nanostructured films of polypyrrole and p53 antibodies, and image analysis of scanning electron microscopy data made it possible to correlate morphological changes of the biosensor with the concentration of cells containing the cancer biomarker p53. The selectivity of the biosensor was proven by distinguishing images obtained with exposure of the biosensor to cells containing the biomarker from those acquired with cells that did not contain it. Detection was confirmed with cyclic voltammetry measurements, while the adsorption of the p53 biomarker was probed with polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption (PM-IRRAS) and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Adsorption is described using the Langmuir-Freundlich model, with saturation taking place at a concentration of 100 Ucells/mL. Taken together, our results point to novel ways to detect biomarkers or any type of analyte for which detection is based on adsorption as is the case of the majority of biosensors.
