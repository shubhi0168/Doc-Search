 Relational databases  

At present very large volumes of information are being regularly produced in the world. Most of this information is unstructured, lacking the properties usually expected from, for instance, relational databases. One of the more interesting issues in computer science is how, if possible, may we achieve data mining on such unstructured data. Intuitively, its analysis has been attempted by devising schemes to identify patterns and trends through means such as statistical pattern learning. The basic problem of this approach is that the user has to decide, a priori, the model of the patterns and, furthermore, the way in which they are to be found in the data. This is true regardless of the kind of data, be it textual, musical, financial or otherwise. In this paper we explore an alternative paradigm in which raw data is categorized by analyzing a large corpus from which a set of categories and the different instances in each category are determined, resulting in a structured database. Then each of the instances is mapped into a numerical value which preserves the underlying patterns. This is done using a genetic algorithm and a set of multi-layer perceptron networks. Every categorical instance is then replaced by the adequate numerical code. The resulting numerical database may be tackled with the usual clustering algorithms. We hypothesize that any unstructured data set may be approached in this fashion. In this work we exemplify with a textual database and apply our method to characterize texts by different authors and present experimental evidence that the resulting databases yield clustering results which permit authorship identification from raw textual data.
