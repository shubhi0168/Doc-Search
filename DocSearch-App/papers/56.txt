 Symbolic computation  

A function transformation is presented to change a kind of nonlinear coupled system into a set of two elliptic equations of the first kind. Then new infinite sequence complexion two-soliton solutions to a kind of nonlinear coupled system are constructed by new solutions and Backlund transformation of elliptic equation of the first kind.
