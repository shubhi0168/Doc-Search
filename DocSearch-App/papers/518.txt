 Data structures  

Associative memories are data structures that allow retrieval of previously stored messages given part of their content. They, thus, behave similarly to the human brain's memory that is capable, for instance, of retrieving the end of a song, given its beginning. Among different families of associative memories, sparse ones are known to provide the best efficiency (ratio of the number of bits stored to that of the bits used). Recently, a new family of sparse associative memories achieving almost optimal efficiency has been proposed. Their structure, relying on binary connections and neurons, induces a direct mapping between input messages and stored patterns. Nevertheless, it is well known that nonuniformity of the stored messages can lead to a dramatic decrease in performance. In this paper, we show the impact of nonuniformity on the performance of this recent model, and we exploit the structure of the model to improve its performance in practical applications, where data are not necessarily uniform. In order to approach the performance of networks with uniformly distributed messages presented in theoretical studies, twin neurons are introduced. To assess the adapted model, twin neurons are used with the real-world data to optimize power consumption of electronic circuits in practical test cases.
