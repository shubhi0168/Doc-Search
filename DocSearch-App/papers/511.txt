 Distributed computing  

Assembling and simultaneously using different types of distributed computing infrastructures (DCI) like Grids and Clouds is an increasingly common situation. Because infrastructures are characterized by different attributes such as price, performance, trust, and greenness, the task scheduling problem becomes more complex and challenging. In this paper we present the design for a fault-tolerant and trust-aware scheduler, which allows to execute Bag-of-Tasks applications on elastic and hybrid DCI, following user defined scheduling strategies. Our approach, named Promethee scheduler, combines a pull-based scheduler with multi-criteria Promethee decision making algorithm. Because multi-criteria scheduling leads to the multiplication of the possible scheduling strategies, we propose SOFT, a methodology that allows to find the optimal scheduling strategies given a set of application requirements. The validation of this method is performed with a simulator that fully implements the Promethee scheduler and recreates an hybrid DCI environment including Internet Desktop Grid, Cloud and Best Effort Grid based on real failure traces. A set of experiments shows that the Promethee scheduler is able to maximize user satisfaction expressed accordingly to three distinct criteria: price, expected completion time and trust, while maximizing the infrastructure useful employment from the resources owner point of view. Finally, we present an optimization which bounds the computation time of the Promethee algorithm, making realistic the possible integration of the scheduler to a wide range of resource management software.
