 network security  

Getting higher occurrence of cybercrimes by means of hacking, identity theft, and network security violations necessitates a robust system for resolving these issues. For the new era of IT, using conventional user authentication methods like providing login IDs, passwords /PIN and other two-factor authentication methods are fading to offer the required level of security required. Since biometrics come forward as an efficient alternative technique to provide security. Keystroke and typing dynamics uses behavioral characteristics like typing rhythms of a person for authentication. This protection method effortlessly integrates with the existing environment and it could be scaled across the web also. This technology is will be getting promoted in the upcoming years because of its non-invasiveness, unobtrusiveness and low deployment cost. Thereby security of the physical and logical access can be improved. This proposed technique acts as a supplementary security layer besides the traditional user IDs & passwords/PIN, most organizations are making supplementary investments in keystroke and typing dynamics to ensure a more robust user authentication system.
