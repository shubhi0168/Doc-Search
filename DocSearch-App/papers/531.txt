At the present time virtual simulation has become a very popular subject in computer graphics. The main goal of the simulation in the context of computer graphics is reproducing the natural phenomena surrounding us in a more true-to-life possible way. When representing natural phenomena, more sensible factor is increasing the reality. Among many kinds of simulations realistic ocean simulation has become an important arena. Actually, it is a very interesting natural object to model because two third of the surface of the earth is covered by the ocean and water is an intrinsic part of day to day life. There are different models to represent ocean surface. However, due to highly dynamic behavior of the ocean, representing the visual complexity of these phenomena using basic simulation models is a challenge. Thus ocean water simulation is a computationally expensive process. The main aim of this research is proposing a substantive ocean wave visualization model taking into account different sea states proposed by Beaufort Sea scale. Since yet there is no such single approach with a satisfactory outcome. The state of the sea is changing time to time according to wind speed and other various phenomena. This dynamic feature is very important for serious computer games and simulators use for maritime trainings. The rendering mechanism suggests in this thesis is intended to provide an efficient and accurate method to represent the high quality of visual characteristics and runs in real time to produce highly realistic ocean scenes regardless of the complexity of the wave model. Building a mathematical model for representing the shape of the ocean surface is not an objective of this research. But suitable existing wave models are used for the study. Further this thesis is trying to identify the most suitable wave model among different kind of existing wave models for representing the each selected sea state.
