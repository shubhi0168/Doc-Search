 Operating systems  

Between 2008 and 2015, bus rapid transit system (BRTS) in India increased its implementation from two cities to eight cities with a significant increase in total ridership. This paper attempts to give a detailed review of BRTS implementation in cities of India. This is a systematic effort that could inform readers about the current system and network characteristics of Indian BRTS. Different system and corridor characteristics including off board and on board ticketing systems are adopted in India. Gross cost revenue collection model is adopted by almost all special purpose vehicle (SPV) companies developed to manage BRT systems. A variety of carriageway concept designs for BRTS are implemented in these cities considering a right of way of 22, 24, 30, 32, 40, 45, 60 meters respectively. Out of the eight cities, Ahmedabad has almost 30% of the total fleet size. In terms of regulatory context, SPV companies are formed in almost all eight cities after observing Ahmedabad BRT success. Documentation of these operating systems shall provide a sound database to planners and decision makers actively involved with BRT system implementation in developing countries.
