 Algorithm design  

A neural network technique known as Kohonen unsupervised training is coupled with a modified version of the particle swarm optimization technique in an effort to develop an algorithm capable of finding multiple optimal solutions for a given problem. The results of five example problems of increasing difficulty validate the Alternative Analysis Networking algorithm's functionality.
