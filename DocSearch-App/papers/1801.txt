 Data structures  

Hashing is an important technique to achieve high code performance in a variety of data processing applications. The concept is emphasized in Computer Science curricula, and the IT industry values graduates who can use hashing skillfully. Although several implementation details of hashing are routinely handled by software libraries, it remains the responsibility of the programmer to choose a suitable hash function (a poor hash function can degrade performance). Researchers have designed a number of generic hash functions, but environments for code development do not offer these as off-the-shelf solutions. It is also curious that textbooks and reference books do not point learners to this rich resource. Our paper remedies this deficiency by providing learners with an easy way to compare their own hash function's performance with these alternatives. Our assistive tool is an Eclipse plugin for Java programs, and we have focused only on traditional hash functions (non-cryptographic hash functions that do not preserve distance). However, our approach can be extended easily to other programming languages, development environments and hash function classes.
