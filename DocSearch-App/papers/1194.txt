Cyber-physical system (CPS) is an emerging area, which cannot work efficiently without proper software handling of the data and business logic. Software and middleware is the soul of the CPS. The software development of CPS is a critical issue because of its complicity in a large scale realistic system. Furthermore, object-oriented approach (OOA) is often used to develop CPS software, which needs some improvements according to the characteristics of CPS. To develop software in a CPS environment, a new systematic approach is proposed in this paper. It comes from practice, and has been evolved from software companies. It consists of (A) Requirement analysis in event-oriented way, (B) architecture design in data-oriented way, (C) detailed design and coding in object-oriented way and (D) testing in event-oriented way. It is a new approach based on OOA; the difference when compared with OOA is that the proposed approach has different emphases and measures in every stage. It is more accord with the characteristics of event-driven CPS. In CPS software development, one should focus on the events more than the functions or objects. A case study of a smart home system is designed to reveal the effectiveness of the approach. It shows that the approach is also easy to be operated in the practice owing to some simplifications. The running result illustrates the validity of this approach.
