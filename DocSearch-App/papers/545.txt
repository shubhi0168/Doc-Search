 Algorithm design  

Augmented Reality & Mobile Augmented Reality has very widely used in nowadays Smartphone's and there is not any Software Architecture available. So when one application will develop for Mobile Augmented Reality will targeted only on one mobile handsets or device. When the device will change for some reason the application will require to Re-Architect because of its operating system and handle the network and GPS. Also the application will required to Install in device and require some kind of storage and some extra libraries to developed Mobile Augmented Reality System. In this paper propose algorithm for web based service oriented architecture for mobile augmented reality system. Using this prototype algorithm user can design any mobile augmented reality system application; also extend the services using current web services. A Framework is proposed in order to achieve any Application design using this Software Architecture will run on any mobile device platforms without the need for Installation or no Installation. Architecture will give the "Web Based Interface" so the User's have some kind of Network support and GPS Support will easily get the Application on any mobile Device. Also the framework will base on SOA so web services will design according to handle the Mobile data e.g. Images, Audio, and Video etc. to and from the web server. Software Architecture will give the Application to Portability, extensibility, No Need for Installation, Reusability without any code change. Same code will run on multiple mobile devices without the OS limitation and any third party will design his own application using the same code or extend it as per his choice.
