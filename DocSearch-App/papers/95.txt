 Symbolic computation  

A modeling language for hybrid systems HydLa and its implementation HyLaGI are described. HydLa is a constraint-based language that can handle uncertainties of models smoothly. HyLaGI calculates trajectories by symbolic formula manipulation to exclude errors resulting from floating-point arithmetic. HyLaGI features a nondeterministic simulation algorithm so it can calculate all possible qualitative different trajectories of models with uncertainties.
