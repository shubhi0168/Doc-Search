 Symbolic computation  

Associated with the prime number p = 3, the generalized bilinear operators are adopted to yield an extended Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-like (eKP-like) equation. With symbolic computation, eighteen classes of rational solutions to the resulting eKP-like equation are generated from a search for polynomial solutions to the corresponding generalized bilinear equation.
