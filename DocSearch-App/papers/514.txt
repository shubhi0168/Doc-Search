 Image processing  

Assessment of the physical properties of agricultural and food products has always been of major importance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of estimating physicochemical properties of raw cane sugars using digital image processing and colorimetric measurements. Various characteristics of raw cane sugars such as ash, sucrose, invert sugar, solution color, pH, starch, dextran, moisture and refractive index of some Iranian and imported raw cane sugar samples were examined. Additionally, the images of samples were captured by a flat scanner, and different morphological characteristics such as area, perimeter, squareness and count number of crystal were determined using MATLAB software. In addition, the CIE color coordinates by a spectroradiometer with wavelength range of 380-780 nm were measured. Results demonstrated that there was a good correlation between certain morphological behaviors and some physicochemical properties of raw cane sugars. For example, some relationships between the area mean and dextran (r = 0.72), perimeter mean and dextran (r = 0.75) and squareness and starch (r = 0.76) were found. Moreover, correlations between certain physicochemical parameters such as ash, sucrose, invert sugar, solution color, dextran, pH and refractive index and some CIE color coordinates values such as L*, a*, b*, C*, h, X, Y, Z, x and y were indicated. Determining the physicochemical properties of raw cane sugars appears feasible using digital image analysis technique.
