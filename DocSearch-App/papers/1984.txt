 Data structures  

In distribution and transmission electric power companies, many losses and risks are associated with corrosive processes that occur in buried structures, such as tower leg foundations of overhead transmission lines. Tower leg corrosion control at the foundation involves the collection and analysis of data generated by different inspection methods and practices for routine maintenance and repair. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a methodology developed to identify locations and towers most susceptible to high rates of metal corrosion at the foundation of tower legs in order to facilitate better maintenance planning and evaluate the failure risks of these assets. To this end, using the Delphi methodology, variables that affect the corrosion phenomenon are correlated with geographic information and generate algebraic maps for advanced analysis. Despite the difficulty of searching and correlating georeferenced data, the results are interesting and promise possibilities for future applications.
