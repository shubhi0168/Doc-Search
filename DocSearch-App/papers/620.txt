Background: Avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) can lead to a loss in millions of dollars in poultry annually because of mortality and produce contamination. Studies have verified that many immune-related genes undergo changes in alternative splicing (AS), along with nonsense mediated decay (NMD), to regulate the immune system under different conditions. Therefore, the splicing profiles of primary lymphoid tissues with systemic APEC infection need to be comprehensively examined. Results: Gene expression in RNAseq data were obtained for three different immune tissues (bone marrow, thymus, and bursa) from three phenotype birds (non-challenged, resistant, and susceptible birds) at two time points. Alternative 5' splice sites and exon skipping/inclusion were identified as the major alternative splicing events in avian primary immune organs under systemic APEC infection. In this study, we detected hundreds of differentiallyexpressed- transcript-containing genes (DETs) between different phenotype birds at 5 days post-infection (dpi). DETs, PSAP and STT3A, with NMD have important functions under systemic APEC infection. DETs, CDC45, CDK1, RAG2, POLR1B, PSAP, and DNASE1L3, from the same transcription start sites (TSS) indicate that cell death, cell cycle, cellular function, and maintenance were predominant in host under systemic APEC. Conclusions: With the use of RNAseq technology and bioinformatics tools, this study provides a portrait of the AS event and NMD in primary lymphoid tissues, which play critical roles in host homeostasis under systemic APEC infection. According to this study, AS plays a pivotal regulatory role in the immune response in chicken under systemic APEC infection via either NMD or alternative TSSs. This study elucidates the regulatory role of AS for the immune complex under systemic APEC infection.
