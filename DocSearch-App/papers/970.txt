Complexity of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and difficulty to predict their behaviour in wireless communications make modelling of IoT units an important research topic. The IoT unit is considered here as the two-node IoT model that supports bi-directional wireless communications. There are many approaches to model security and energy awareness; however, little is known about the synergistic effect of those factors at the application level under the influence of environmental factors such as noise. The paper introduces a modelling framework to model the security-energy-environment issues as main attributes to allow defining quality of service (QoS) for the IoT-based applications. Among others, the healthcare ones are regarded as predominant now. We model IoT units using the feature-based modelling methodology adopted from the software engineering domain. The result of modelling is a set of feature models with valid configurations that describe the energy-security-environment-performance relationships and possible constraints to support various IoT applications. Having feature models, we can select a configuration that is best suited for a given IoT application with respect to QoS requirements. As feature models represent abstract relationships of domain factors, we need additionally to provide experiments to determine concrete values of modelled features. We describe the experimental system to measure energy consumption under the influencing factors. Both models (abstract and concrete) allow reasoning about QoS of the IoT applications.
