Although many changes have been discovered during heart maturation, the genetic mechanisms involved in the changes between immature and mature myocardium have only been partially elucidated. Here, gene expression profile changed between the human fetal and adult heart was characterized. A human microarray was applied to define the gene expression signatures of the fetal (13-17 weeks of gestation, n = 4) and adult hearts (30-40 years old, n = 4). Gene ontology analyses, pathway analyses, gene set enrichment analyses, and signal transduction network were performed to predict the function of the differentially expressed genes. Ten mRNAs were confirmed by quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction. 5547 mRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed. "Cell cycle" was the most enriched pathway in the down-regulated genes. EFGR, IGF1R, and ITGB1 play a central role in the regulation of heart development. EGFR, IGF1R, and FGFR2 were the core genes regulating cardiac cell proliferation. The quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction results were concordant with the microarray data. Our data identified the transcriptional regulation of heart development in the second trimester and the potential regulators that play a prominent role in the regulation of heart development and cardiac cells proliferation.
