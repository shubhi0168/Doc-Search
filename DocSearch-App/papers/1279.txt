 Algorithm design  

Designed with the goal of mimicking key features of real HPC workloads, mini-apps have become an important tool for co-design. An investigation of mini-app behavior can provide system designers with insight into the impact of architectures, programming models, and tools on application performance. Mini-apps can also serve as a platform for fast algorithm design space exploration, allowing the application developers to evaluate their design choices before significantly redesigning the application codes. Consequently, it is prudent to develop a mini-app alongside the full blown application it is intended to represent. In this paper, we present CMT-bone a mini-app for the compressible multiphase turbulence (CMT) application, CMT-nek, being developed to extend the physics of the CESAR Nek5000 application code. CMT-bone consists of the most computationally intensive kernels of CMT-nek and the communication operations involved in nearest-neighbor updates and vector reductions. The mini-app represents CMT-nek in its most mature state and going forward it will be developed in parallel with the CMT-nek application to keep pace with key new performance impacting changes. We describe these kernels and discuss the role that CMT-bone has played in enabling interdisciplinary collaboration by allowing application developers to work with computer scientists on performance optimization on current architectures and performance analysis on notional future systems.
