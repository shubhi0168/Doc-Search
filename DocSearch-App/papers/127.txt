A non-destructive methodology was developed to automatically detect and quantify bruise volumes in the equatorial region of apples, using X-ray CT images. Grey level threshold values were calculated to segment bruises in 'Jonagold', 'Joly Red' and 'Kanzi' apple fruit using the multi-level Otsu's threshold method. Comparisons were made between the CT-based bruise volume estimates and bruise volume estimates that were based on destructive measurements in combination with simple geometric assumptions. Visualisation of the bruises in both 2 and 3D showed that bruises, resulting from a pendulum impact with a spherical impactor, can be highly irregularly shaped which implies that the bruise volume estimations based on simple geometric assumptions cannot deliver accurate results.
