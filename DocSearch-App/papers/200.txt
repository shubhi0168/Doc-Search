 Image processing  

A suitable piece of software is presented to connect Abaqus, a sophisticated finite element package, with Matlab, the most comprehensive program for mathematical analysis. This interface between these well-known codes not only benefits from the image processing and the integrated graph-plotting features of Matlab but also opens up new opportunities in results post-processing, statistical analysis and mathematical optimization, among many other possibilities. The software architecture and usage are appropriately described and two problems of particular engineering significance are addressed to demonstrate its capabilities. Firstly, the software is employed to assess cleavage fracture through a novel 3-paranieter Weibull probabilistic framework. Then, its potential to create and train neural networks is used to identify damage parameters through a hybrid experimental-numerical scheme, and model crack propagation in structural materials by means of a cohesive zone approach.
