Chlamydophila pneumoniae, a Gram-negative bacterium belongs to the family Chlamydiaceae, is known to cause community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis. There is a need for genomic analyses of C. pneumoniae as its chronic infections result in reactive airway disease, lung cancer and asthma. Recent advancement in the sequencing techniques led to the generation of large genomic data. In order to utilize these data, sequence-based function predictions were used for annotating the uncharacterized genes. The genome of C. pneumoniae encodes 1052 proteins, which include a group of 366 functionally uncharacterized proteins, known as "hypothetical proteins" (HPs). Functions of these HPs were predicted by utilizing an integrated approach that combines varieties of bioinformatics tools. The functions of 142 proteins were successfully predicted and categorized into different classes of enzymes, transport proteins, binding proteins and virulence factors. Among these functionally annotated HPs, we were able to identify 12 virulent HPs. Furthermore, the HP with the highest virulence score was subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to better understand their dynamical behavior in explicit water conditions. These analyses could be utilized for an in-depth understanding of virulence mechanism. The functional knowledge of these proteins could be useful in drug design and discovery process of infections caused by C. pneumoniae.
