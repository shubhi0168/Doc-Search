 Relational databases  

A reference architecture for supporting secure big data analytics over Cloud-enabled relational databases, which is based on our previous Attribute-Order-Preserving-Free-SFS (AOPF-SFS) algorithm, is proposed in this paper. In this architecture, the skyline operator acts as "baseline" component for building secure big data analytics, in a smoothly and algebra-like manner. We provide general concepts and functionalities of the architecture, along with future research directions in secure big data analytics research.
