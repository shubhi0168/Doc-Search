 Computer programming  

Computer programming is a challenge for students and a major reason why people avoid Computer Science courses. Investigating alternative teaching methods is essential to encourage students to learn and understand the concepts of programming. The use of games in learning and training is advocated and supported by many researchers due to its motivational and attractive features. This study focuses on an approach that supports the use of learning methodologies based on constructionist activities. Therefore, a pedagogical framework is proposed to guide lecturers who teach programming on how to integrate games-based learning to present coding concepts in the context of familiar real world applications like computer games development. The framework is supported by motivational and attractive game features in conjunction with the authentic and meaningful aspects of constructionist activities for Games-Based Construction Learning (GBCL). This paper summarises and presents a framework model based on a literature review and a panel of experts, with a view to performing a two-stage process to validate this framework. The paper discusses the design and validation of the framework and proposes actions regarding its implementation.
