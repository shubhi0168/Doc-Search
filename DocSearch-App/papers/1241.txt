 Relational databases  

Data-intensive systems in e-governance collect and process data to ensure conformance to a set of business rules. Testers meticulously verify data in test databases, extracted from different steps of a live production stream, for correct application of business rules. We simplify the process by allowing testers to model a test domain on a relational database and automatically generate test cases representing data interactions satisfying combinatorial interaction coverage criteria. This paper also introduces test cases with self-referential interactions, which is a necessity in real-world databases. We verify these test cases using our human-in-the-loop tool, DEPICT. DEPICT, with expert assistance, generates complex SQL queries for test cases and produces a visual report of test case satisfaction. We apply the approach to two scenarios: 1) simplify and optimize a periodic archiving operation and 2) verify fault codes within the testing environment of the Custom directorate's TVINN system.
