 Symbolic computation  

Fractional derivatives are powerful tools in solving the problems of science and engineering. In this paper, an analytical algorithm for solving fractional differential-difference equations in the sense of Jumarie's modified Riemann-Liouville derivative has been described and demonstrated. The algorithm has been tested against time-fractional differential-difference equations of rational type via symbolic computation. Three examples are given to elucidate the solution procedure. Our analyses lead to closed form exact solutions in terms of hyperbolic, trigonometric, and rational functions, which might be subject to some adequate physical interpretations in the future.
